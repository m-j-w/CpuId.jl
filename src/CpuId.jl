Read the CPU's [Time Stamp Counter, TSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter),

cycle, until reset.  This function has, when inlined, practically no overhead
and is, thus, probably the fasted method to count how many cycles the CPU has
spent working since last read.

Note, the TSC runs at a constant rate if `hasfeature(:TSCINV)==true`;
otherwise, it is tied to the current CPU clock frequency.

Hint: This function is extremely efficient when inlined into your own code.
      Convince yourself by typing `@code_native CpuId.cpucycle()`.
      To use this for benchmarking, simply subtract the results of two calls.
      The result is the actual CPU clock cycles spent, independent of the
      current (and possible non-constant) CPU clock frequency.

Obtain information on the CPU's *data* cache sizes.

Determine the data cache size for each cache level as reported by the CPU

tuple indices matching the cache levels; sizes are given in bytes.

If given an integer, then the data cache size of the respective cache level
will be returned.  This is significantly faster than the tuple version above.

Note that these are total cache sizes, where some cache levels are typically
shared by multiple cpu cores, the higher cache levels may include lower levels.
