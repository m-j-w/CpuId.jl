Read the CPU's [Time Stamp Counter, TSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter),

cycle, until reset.  This function has, when inlined, practically no overhead
and is, thus, probably the fasted methods to exactly count how many cycles the
CPU has spent working since last read.

Note, the TSC runs at a constant rate if `hasfeature(:TSCINV)==true`;
otherwise, it is tied to the current CPU clock frequency.

Hint: This function is extremely efficient when inlined into your own code.
      Convince yourself by typing `@code_native CpuId.cpucycle()`.
      To use this for benchmarking, simply subtract the results of two calls.
      The result is the actual CPU clock cycles spent, independent of the
